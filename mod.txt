This requires modification of the generator because this counts in the white spaces & strrim function does not work because the emptiness behind the string is not a space but another character, to find the character

charcode = find(char(0:255) == c) - 1

Extenstion to the code for the generator:
u = size(e,2); l = 1 ;
for y = 1 : u
    if e(y) ~= char(0)
        l = l + 1 ;
    end
end
l = l-1;

There is reference to size in the branching function also
Modify needed

u = size(w,2); l = 1 ;
for y = 1 : u
    if w(y) ~= char(0)
        l = l + 1 ;
    end
end
l = l-1;
When comparing the string for win or lose, modify strcmp function, use w(1:l) (will remove off unnesscary spaces).
